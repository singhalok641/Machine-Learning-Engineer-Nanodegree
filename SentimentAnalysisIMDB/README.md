## Project 1: Deploy a sentiment analysis model
### Project Overview
This is a SageMaker deployment project! In this project I constructed a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. I created this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, deployed the model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
